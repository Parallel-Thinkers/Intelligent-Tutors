  "body": "# Intelligent-Tutors\r\n  The Indian National Curriculum Framework has a part of the objectives the development of mathematical\r\nthinking and problem solving ability. However, recent studies conducted at Indian metros reported concern for studentsâ€™\r\nmathematics learning. Regular classroom teaching, except in some private coaching, does not include teaching of problem\r\nsolving in mathematics and involves mere practicing exercises and drill of known exercises. Schoenfeld gave a framework for\r\ndescribing mathematical thinking containing four components: resources, heuristics, controls and beliefs. Since childhood we\r\ndevelop ontology of the notions we learn. This ontology gets expanded when we keep learning more. Ontologies used for\r\nteaching need to incorporate elements of mathematical thinking popularized by problem solving experts. So, teaching by using\r\nsuch ontology of problems, problem solving methods, and tasks would be beneficial to students. In this paper we argue about\r\nhow and why ontologies can be used for teaching problem solving in mathematics at high school level. As a proof of concept we\r\ngive examples and describe an ontology named MONTO that can be used for teaching problem solving in mathematics. Also, we\r\ndiscuss and compare the MONTO ontology with some other ontologies available in the literature that are used for teaching. We\r\ndeveloped and evaluated the MONTO ontology for Surface Area and Volume (3D Solids) problems taught as part of the national\r\ncurriculum in India and the results obtained were satisfactory.",
