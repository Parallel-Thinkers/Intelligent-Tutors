<li class="rvps6" style="margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px"><span class="rvts11">There you can see the information about your a) Problem Solving Progress b) Misconceptions c) Missing Concepts d) Learned Concepts (specific to particular problem type) e) Learning profile of Mensuration Domain and f) Activity </span></li>
<li class="rvps6" style="margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px"><span class="rvts11">Problem solving progress is in general for all problem types in which you can see how many problems of each level you have solved for each problem type and the percentage of its correctness. Also, it combines all percentage of correctness of all the three levels and shows overall percentage of correctness. This correctness is calculated based on the list of tasks you complete correctly while solving a problem correctly. </span></li>
<li class="rvps6" style="margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px"><span class="rvts11">Misconceptions and Missing Concepts are captured from your Learning mode interaction and solving mode interaction. These are captured commonly for all problems. The information displayed shows the percentage of resolving and remedial feedback for the same. If the percentage is more means you are progressing towards removing the misconception and the missing concept which is captured during the interaction. </span></li>
<li class="rvps6" style="margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px"><span class="rvts11">Learned concepts displays the information of concepts you have learned for particular problem type in a tabular form where list of concepts and the number of times you have learned that concept are displayed. &nbsp;With the displayed learned concept you can see in the brackets the schematic connection of that particular problem type. Also, the same is showed by using 3D Bar charts. </span></li>
<li class="rvps6" style="margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px"><span class="rvts11">Learning profile of mensuration domain shows information about the mensuration problem types you have learned for each shape. For example it displays percentage of TSA problems learned from each shape, percentage of LSA problems learned for each shape, percentage of SA with Less Faces problems learned for each shape and percentage of volume problems learned for each shape. </span></li>
<li class="rvps6" style="margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px"><span class="rvts11">Activity shows that how much time (in seconds) you have spent on Learning Mode and Solving Mode for various problem types. &nbsp;</span></li>
<li class="rvps6" style="margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px"><span class="rvts11">Learned concepts are problem specific. So to see the information regarding learned concepts in the Learning Profile a problem type should be selected. &nbsp;</span></li>
